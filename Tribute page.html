                About the President
            </h1>
            <p class="about">
                ☛ (born February 12, 1809, near Hodgenville, Kentucky, U.S.—died April 15, 1865, Washington, D.C.), 16th president of the United States (1861–65),<br> who preserved the Union during the American Civil War and brought about the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States
                <br><br>
                ☛ Among American heroes, Lincoln continues to have a unique appeal for his fellow countrymen and also for people of other lands. 
            <br>
                 His charm derives from his remarkable life story—the rise from humble origins, the dramatic death—and from his distinctively human and humane personality<br> as well as from his historical role as saviour of the Union and emancipator of enslaved people. 
            <br><br>
                ☛ His father, Thomas Lincoln, was the descendant of a weaver’s apprentice who had migrated from England to Massachusetts in 1637. 
                <br><br>
                ☛ In December 1816, faced with a lawsuit challenging the title to his Kentucky farm, Thomas Lincoln moved with his family to southwestern Indiana.
                <br><br>
                ☛ The unhappiest period of his boyhood followed the death of his mother in the autumn of 1818. As a ragged nine-year-old, he saw her buried in the forest,<br> then faced a winter without the warmth of a mother’s love.
            <br><br>
                ☛ Aspiring to be a legislator, he was defeated in his first try and then repeatedly reelected to the state assembly.
            <br><br>
                ☛ He considered blacksmithing as a trade but finally decided in favour of the law. Already having taught himself grammar and mathematics, he began to study law books.<br> In 1836, having passed the bar examination, he began to practice law.
            <br><br>
                ☛ The next year he moved to Springfield, Illinois, the new state capital, which offered many more opportunities for a lawyer than New Salem did. 
            <br><br>
                ☛ While residing in New Salem, Lincoln became acquainted with Ann Rutledge. Apparently he was fond of her, and certainly he grieved with the entire community at her untimely death, in 1835, at the age of 22.
            <br><br>
                ☛ So far as can be known, the first and only real love of Lincoln’s life was Mary Todd.
            <br><br>
                ☛  Finally the two got married on November 4, 1842 and the union was blessed with four children (all boys).
            <br><br>
                ☛ For about five years Lincoln took little part in politics, and then a new sectional crisis gave him a chance to reemerge and rise to statesmanship.
            <br><br>
                ☛ He finaaly became president in 1860 and died April 15, 1865, Washington, D.C.
